## Exercise 2

Reads the `iris.csv` dataset, prints the euclidean distance and the cosine similiarity between every consecutive pair of points, and calculates the **mean**, **median**, **variance** and **standard deviation** for each attribute. Usage: `python parser.py`

## Exercise 3

Reads the `KarateClub.csv` dataset and to represent and show a graph in an **adjecency matrix**. Calculates the **mean**,**max** and **min** degree of the graph. Shows an **histogram** of the distribution of the degree frequency. Usage: `python parser.py`
